# Breast-Cancer-Classification-and-Prediction-using-Histopathology-Images
In this project, I have taken an approach using Deep Learning Neural Network  CNN to try to predict whether a histopathology image of the  human tissue is cancerous or non-cancerous, and if cancerous,  what stage does it belong to: in-situ, Invasive Ductal Carcinoma Stage 1 (IDC 1), IDC 2, IDC 3 and IDC 4.
